  <strong>Size It Up</strong> is an NPM module for backend and frontend developers that logs the size of a directory and its files.
</p>

Ever wondered how much digital weight your directories are carrying? Look no further! Introducing sizeitup - an easy command-line tool that displays directory and file sizes. It's time to shed those digital pounds!

## ü¶Ñ Features
* Displays the size of a directory and its files
* Easy to use
* Lightweight

## üì¶ Install Size It Up

To bring sizeitup into your life, simply run:

```bash
npm install -g sizeitup
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

To let sizeitup work its magic on a given directory, run:

```bash
sizeitup <directory> [--show-files] [--depth <depth>]
```
Replace `<directory>` with the path to the directory you want to analyze.

### Flags
* `--show-files`: Include files adn their sizes in the output - because we all know size matters!
* `--depth <depth>`: Specify the depth of the directory tree to display. The default is Infinity.

## üîß Example
```bash
sizeitup ./example-dir --show-files
```

It's time to sizeitup and see which directories need to hit the digital gym!
